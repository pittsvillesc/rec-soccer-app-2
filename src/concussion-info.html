                            Remember, you can't see a concussion and some athletes may not experience and/or report symptoms until
                            hours or days after the injury.  Most people with a concussion will recover quickly and fully.  But for some
                            people, signs and symptoms of concussion can last for days, weeks, or longer.

                            Do not try to judge the severity of the injury yourself.  Health care professionals have a number of methods that they 
                            can use to assess the severity of concussions.  As a coach, review the information below to be able to help the health care
                            professionals in assessing the athlete after the injury.

                            A repeat concussion that occurs before the brain recovers from the initial concussion - usually within a short period of 
                            time (hours, days, or weeks) - can slow recovery or increase the likelihood of having longterm problems.  In rare cases,
                            repeat concussions can result in edema (brain swelling), permanent brain damage, and even death.
